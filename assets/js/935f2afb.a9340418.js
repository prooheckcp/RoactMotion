It was inspired in Flipper, Framer Motion (from React) and the TweenService. These 3 different libraries together along with my need for a proper solution when it comes to animating React brought this library to live!

But right now you probably still have some questions which hopefully we\'ll be covering in the following parts of this tutorial! And one of those questions might be, what if I want to play an animation from outside of one of these events? What if I want to call the animation at a specific situation? What if I want to animate a different object from the current one? And the answer to all of those questions are animation objects! Let\'s see how they work...","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"docs/Guide/ChainedAnimations":{"id":"docs/Guide/ChainedAnimations","title":"Chained Animations","description":"Wow we\'ve already been thru a lot together!

We\'ll start by looking into events! In order to use events we use the `RoactMotion.Event` reference. Let\'s start by adding a hovering event.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"docs/Guide/Start":{"id":"docs/Guide/Start","title":"Start","description":"This Guide assumes you\'ve already installed Roact Motion, make sure to install it before moving forward!","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"docs/Guide/TutorialIntroduction":{"id":"docs/Guide/TutorialIntroduction","title":"\ud83d\udcd7Tutorial","description":"Grab your notebook and get ready for this step by step guide!
