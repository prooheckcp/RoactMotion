# üìÅInstallation

:::caution

**ProQuest** is 100% dependant on two other libraries. Without these ProQuest won't function.

They are only used internally so you don't need to know how do they function, you will however need to download them and drop them intro a place such as **ReplicatedStorage**, or anywhere you wish.

Dependencies:

[ProNet](https://prooheckcp.github.io/ProNet/docs/Installation)

[ProStore3](https://prooheckcp.github.io/ProStore3/docs/Installation)

:::

Links to ProQuest, this will depend on where Dubit wants to store it -
