## Introduction

ProQuest is a robust quest system for Roblox that manages everything for you letting you focus specifically on the logic of your quests in particular. It automatically saves and loads your quests progress and provides you a lifecycle to make the quests logic more flexible.

## Why ProQuest?

A huge amount of games require quest systems and one point or another and this is something that is always hard to get right and that takes quite a long time to plan out and make it work properly. ProQuest removes this layer of complexity by giving you an extremely flexible quest system that already manages everything for you letting you focus specifically on the logic required to complete the quests.

**Pros:** 
- Automatic saving/loading
- Multiple quest options
- Quests lifecycle
- Network layer
