Roact Motion is a library built for specific use within the Roact framework. It was inspired in Flipper, Framer Motion (from React) and the TweenService. These 3 different libraries together along with my need for a proper solution when it comes to animating React brought this library to live! We'll be learning today how to install, get started and use this library to its full potential!

## Why Roact Motion?

As the popularity of Roact keeps increasing and more recent games tend to use this framework to build their UIs it's important to have an easy way to animate them and bring them to life! Roact has never been exactly the most animation friendly framework out there and so far the community hasn't developed that many solutions, until... now!
